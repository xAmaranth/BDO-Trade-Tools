Trading in Black Desert Online involves buying items at specific locations (called Nodes), then travelling to another Node, where you can sell those items at a profit. Since your profits will vary depending on the value of the goods you've purchased and the distance you've travelled, and since it takes time to travel the roads betwteen Nodes, the amount of silver (the game's currency) you make per hour spent trading can vary wildly based on what trades you decide to do.

The goal of this application is to apply a heuristic search function to identify the trade route that optimizes silver earned per hour spent, based on the silver earned per trade route and the time it takes to finish each trade.
